# KYH - Project 2 - React : Take Your Time

### What is the app?

The app was part of an assignment to create a React-application that can submit data to a WebAPI. The application was created in React 18 LTS and was design ued Material UI. Components that are used in the project but currently not used in the "current" version of the software is FullCalendar.

## Components used:

To structure the layering of the application Paper was used as a container, with Toolbar for the menu and the accompanied Button-component. Most of the design was lifted out of classic Android Design 101 and was a early try to make a semi-fluid WebApp that works just as well on a computer. I will try to evolve the calendar-functionality and make some sort of GTD-app. This application will be used as a vehicle to learn new techniques as I evolve my knowledge in React.

Next step will be to connect Strapi, with user-management and separate calendars using JWT:s.
